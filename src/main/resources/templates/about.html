		<h3>Hi, I'm Shaun.</h3>
		<img class="float-right" th:src="@{/images/me.png}" style="width:250px;height:250px; border-radius:125px">
		<h3>I am a software engineer and a tech enthusiast. I have many ideas about how modern technology can greatly improve
		our day to day lives and am thrilled to live in a time where components and products can be obtained and built with such ease at a 
		relatively low cost. I am particularly interested in assistive technology to help disabled people regain lost motor skills.
		My brother was in a car accident in 1996 when I was just 12 years old that left him disabled for life. There was not much therapy
		offered to him and he had to accept that he would never walk again. With practice he did walk again but with great distortion. 
		While studying mechanical engineering my eyes were opened to the amount of equipment and therapies there are out there that could help someone 
		like my brother. I took my brother to Germany after my studies and we began therapy. I was blown away at some of the assistive technologies
		that I seen while attending some trade fairs, specifically rehacare (https://www.rehacare.com). As an engineer I had many ideas about 
		how I could help my brother without spending a fortune on reha products and so I started building with my 3D printer and Arduino.
		I created this website because I'm sure that there are other makers out there just like me wanting to share their ideas and help people
		improve their lives. I really enjoy reading stories about people solving problems with technology that they have made with 
		off-the-shelf components and unfortunately make magazine was cancelled.<br> 
		Anybody can read the articles which are submitted to this website, but in order to submit an article you must sign-up and email me at 
		shaun.haldane@gmail.com to request article uploading privileges in which I will review your article. 
		I will then authorise you to upload your article and ary other aticle that you may have in the future.<br>
		I look forward to reading your content.<br><br>
		Shaun Haldane
